# EEGAnaysis class

This class is intended to perform in a quick way the first steps of the EEG preprocessing. The class performs 
An example of how it can be used can be found in *example.py*.

The class implements the main preprocessing steps that can be applied to an EEG signal

* data loading 
* spatial filtering
* temporal filtering
* signal segmentation 

and some methods for the signal characteristics visualization

* raw visualization
* power spectral density
* mean epoch amplitude
* ERDS maps
